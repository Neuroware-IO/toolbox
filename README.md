### Introducing The Blockchain Embassy of Asia

[The Blockchain Embassy of Asia](http://bce.asia) is a non-profit digitally distributed organization that is using and promoting blockchain governance as a method for collaboration between various business entities and existing community efforts across Southeast Asia. We bridge the technical divide between organizations, national agencies and regulators throughout the region by providing access to our growing repositories of collaborative research. Our sandbox environment not only provides a technical foundation for growth, but also features legal frameworks too.
